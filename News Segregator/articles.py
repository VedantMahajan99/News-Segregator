# Ai and climate change news:

article_9 = """Earlier this month, OpenAI announced it had built the biggest AI model in history. This astonishingly large model, known as GPT-3, is an impressive technical achievement. Yet it highlights a troubling and harmful trend in the field of artificial intelligence—one that has not gotten enough mainstream attention.

Modern AI models consume a massive amount of energy, and these energy requirements are growing at a breathtaking rate. In the deep learning era, the computational resources needed to produce a best-in-class AI model has on average doubled every 3.4 months; this translates to a 300,000x increase between 2012 and 2018. GPT-3 is just the latest embodiment of this exponential trajectory. The bottom line: AI has a meaningful carbon footprint today, and if industry trends continue it will soon become much worse. Unless we are willing to reassess and reform today’s AI research agenda, the field of artificial intelligence could become an antagonist in the fight against climate change in the years ahead."""

# Rayshard Brooks case

article_11 = """The Atlanta Officer Who Fatally Shot Rayshard Brooks Has Been Charged With Felony Murder. The Atlanta police officer who fatally shot Rayshard Brooks, a black man who was found asleep in a car in a Wendy's drive-thru line, has been charged with felony murder. Rolfe shot Brooks, 27, as he attempted to run away from police after a struggle in the fast-food restaurant's parking lot last week. Brooks was taken to a nearby hospital but later died from the injuries.In a press conference Wednesday, Fulton County District Attorney Paul L. Howard Jr. announced 11 charges against Atlanta Police Department officer Garrett Rolfe and three charges against the other officer present during the shooting, Devin Brosnan. Brooks' death led to mass protests in Atlanta — on Saturday night, demonstrators set fire to the Wendy's where he had been killed.
Rolfe, 27, was fired from the police department following these protests. He had worked for the Atlanta Police Department since 2013. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Sunday that Rolfe had recently completed courses on de-escalation options and appropriate use of force.
Court documents obtained by the Guardian revealed that Rolfe had attempted to cover up an incident in 2015 where he shot a black man.
In a statement, the APD said that Rolfe and Brosnan arrived at the Wendy's restaurant at 125 University Ave at 10:33 p.m. on Friday night, after police received a complaint that a man had fallen asleep in the drive-thru, forcing other vehicles to drive around it. The officers woke up Brooks and administered a field sobriety test, which he failed.
Video footage from Friday night showed that the officers spoke with Brooks for 41 minutes and 17 seconds, during which time he repeatedly asked if he could walk to his sister's house nearby.
Brooks attempted to flee when officers tried to take him into custody following the sobriety test. During the struggle, Brooks obtained one of the officers' tasers and ran away. The APD had previously said that Rolfe shot because Brooks turned around as if he was about to fire the taser, but Howard said Wednesday that the video footage he reviewed showed that this wasn't the case
"We concluded that Mr. Brooks was running away at the time that the shot was fired," the district attorney said. Howard also told reporters that the taser had already been fired twice and was thus unusable — something that he said the officers knew. ​
